In the project directory, you can run the following tasks to interact with the development environment:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner ([jest](https://jestjs.io/))in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
